<h2 align="center">Digitec & Galaxus Helper</h2>
<br/>
<p align="center">Digitec & Galaxus Helper is an <strong>open-source</strong> UNLISCENCED-licensed <strong>browser extension</strong> designed to analyze pricing on the digitec and galaxus web stores. The Helper will compute and display in various places the <strong>best price</strong> seen for atleast a certain time (to filter out actual sales). The default value for this "certain time" is 10% of the product existance but can be adjusted in the settings. Additionally a cut-off parameter can also be set to avoid incorrect estimations for new product without any reliable pricing history. The Helper is <strong>feature-rich</strong> and aims to remain light-weight.</p>

## Questions

Feel free to open an issue for any question not answered bellow.

**Why doesn't it show the pricing at some places ?**
We only display the pricing at some pre-defined spots to reduce the load we would put on the servers by asking price history. Currently those are: **cart**, **product page**, **comparison**. We plan to add more places in the future.

## Disclaimer

We do not claim ownership of the Digitec or Galaxus branding or names. We simply run a seperate tool on their website to improve consumer experience and pricing transparency. We do not guarantee better prices and don't find deals or similar.
